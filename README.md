tally-wrapper
=============

A wrapper web app that will integrate to Tally. It will store and forward transactions.

Tally has a XML API. It is not easy sending transactions for the layperson. This app is envisaged as a web layer for Tally. From any generic application that needs to send transaction information to Tally, one has to connect to Tally Wrapper and send the transaction. TW will interpret the high level transaction and post the correct low level transactions in Tally.

Objectives of this project:
* Allow transmission of financial transactions from other apps to Tally
* Provide an easy alternative to recording transactions in Tally manually
* Allow storing and sequencing transactions during a network outage so that they can be transmitted when it is back up

A mailing list has been created at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tally-wrapper-dev for the members to collaborate and discuss. Please apply to join that group and get started.
