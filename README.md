tally-wrapper
=============

A wrapper web app that will integrate to Tally. It will store and forward transactions.

Tally has a XML API. It is not easy sending transactions for the layperson. This app is envisaged as a web layer for Tally. From any generic application that needs to send transaction information to Tally, one has to connect to Tally Wrapper and send the transaction. TW will interpret the high level transaction and post the correct low level transactions in Tally.
